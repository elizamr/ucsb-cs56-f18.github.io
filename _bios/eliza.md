bio: >
   Hi! I'm Eliza (she/her/hers), a 4th year Computer Science Major looking forward to graduating this Spring! I originally entered UCSB as a CCS Art Major, but was drawn to the logical and detailed nature of CS during my freshman year. While working to transfer into CS, I often felt like an outsider due to my limited experience in the field. However, when I sought help from peers, their enthusiasm and patience improved my confidence when programming. I understand what it's like to feel intimidated by unfamiliar concepts - but 
   
   
   
   
   - I hope I can do the same for fellow students! My areas of interest in CS include autonomous vehicles, human-computer interaction, and UI/UX design. During my previous internship, I rode in one of Waymo's cars, designed the UI for an online educational service, and helped create a marketing plan to promote the service. I still enjoy art-related hobbies such as illustration, photography, I'd love to talk about any of these topics if you have questions or just want to chat!
