bio: >
   Hi! I'm Eliza (she/her/hers), a 4th year Computer Science Major looking forward to graduating this Spring! I originally entered UCSB as a CCS Art Major, but was drawn to the logical and detailed nature of CS during my freshman year. While working to transfer into CS, I often felt like an outsider due to my limited experience in the field. However, when I sought help from peers, their enthusiasm and teaching abilities instilled a sense of confidence in me - I hope I can do the same for fellow students! My areas of interest in CS include autonomous vehicles, human-computer interaction, and UI/UX design. During my previous internship, I rode in one of Waymo's cars and designed the UI for an online educational service. I'd love to talk about any of these topics if you have questions or just want to chat!
